SPAN: SPectral ANalysis software V4.7
Daniele Gasparri, February 2024


****Plot data window****

This sub window allows to easily plot the data from the ASCII files generated by SPAN.
It reads text files with space or tab separated columns and with the first line containing the names of the columns.

Once you browse for the text file and click the 'Load' button, the program will automatically recognise the column names. Select a name for the x and y axis and plot the data to see them in an IDL style plot.

You can personalise the plot by adding the error bars, set the log scale, add a linear fit (simple fit without considering the uncertainties), set the labels, the range, the size of characters, size and colors of the markers and decide if visualise the legend or not.
You can also save the plot in .eps format, in the same main directory where resides SPAN.

If any error occurr, the program will warn you.
